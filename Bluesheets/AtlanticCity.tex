Atlantic City is one of the world's premier gambling venues. The hotels are unrivaled, the shopping is unparalleled, the food is decadent, the alcohol is cheap, and the money is good - if you are good at poker that is. Slot machines are truly plebeian. The flashing lights and garish pictures are meant to mesmerize the weak willed. Cards are better, but not all card games are alike. Poker is the ultimate test of skill. The cards are secondary. Nothing more than a vehicle through which players match wits.

Harrah's is a chain hotel, with hotels wherever gambling is legal. But none rival the Harrah's in Atlantic City. It is by far the crown jewel of the Harrah's collection, and so plays host to a great variety of very rich, often eccentric, guests.
