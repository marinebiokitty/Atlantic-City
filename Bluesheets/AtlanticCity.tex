Monte-Carlo is one of the world's premier gambling venues. The hotels are unrivaled, the shopping is unparalleled, the food is decadent, the alcohol is cheap, and the money is good - if you know what you are doing. Slot machines are truly plebeian. The flashing lights and garish pictures are meant to mesmerize the weak willed. Cards are better, but not all card games are alike. Poker is the ultimate test of skill. The cards are secondary. Nothing more than the vehicle through which players match wits. Only the best play at the black table at the Casino De Monte-Carlo. You, of course, are among the best in the world.

The black table plays a variety of games, which change on some truly opaque schedule. No one can afford to play often enough to unravel it, and just to step around the gauze curtain that separates the black table from the main floor is quite the steep buy in. Tonight it is Texas hold-em. The hands are quick to play, and the dealer is unusually chatty. \cDealer{\They} has a knowing smile and a glitter in \cDealer{\their} eye. Tonight is dangerous. A lot of money will change hands in the next few hours. But you can't walk away empty handed.
